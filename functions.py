# type casting is the converting of oe data type into another. we have two types of coversions, implicits and explicits
# implicits are automatic and happen within the python compiler.
# explicit are done by the programmer using set functions provided in python.
# functions in python are easy to constarct, we need the key word, the variable and what our code should do.
