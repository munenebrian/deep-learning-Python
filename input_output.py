# here we have practised to use two key functions in python, the input function and the output function.
# we need to mindful that when we use an input function, all our values are actually strings and if we need to do arithmetic calculation of integers we would need to convert them first.
# we can also use string replacement for such examples
str1 = input("What is your first name?")
srt2 = input("What is your second name?")
print("Hello {} {}".format(str1, srt2))
 # for our inputs we used input() and print()
